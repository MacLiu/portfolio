          <h2>Split Pay</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            For HackMidWest 2014, we created Split Pay, an IOS+Android application that allows a user to create a bill for something, which his/her friends can submit payment for a percentage of the bill that they wish to pay. Once enough money is generated for the bill, the app gives all the money to the user who created this bill. Split Pay will be perfect for situations like throwing a party or wanting something for your birthday that is to expensive for one person to give. I was responsible for creating the IOS version of the application, while the others worked on the Android version. I created the entire front end expereince, integrated <a href="https://www.parse.com/">Parse API</a> into my application for persistance to the cloud, and integrated <a href="https://www.simplify.com/commerce/">Simplify API</a> into the application for payment acceptance. My team was able to complete both the IOS and Android version of the application in under 24 hours. <strong>Our team ended up placing runner-up at the hackathon!</strong>

            Have you ever tried making plans with a friends or family member just to find out that they already have plans? Who's Free is an IOS application that infroms you about who is free. To use Who's Free, a user simply sets their status as free or busy,and when there friends or family tries to message them or call the in the application, the application might restrict the user from taking this action based on the status. The pupose of this application is to allow the user to save time while trying to make plans or contact someone. It also infroms the user about which one of their friends are busy. I built the whole application from start to finish using Objective-C and Xcode for the development. I also used <a href="https://www.parse.com/">Parse's</a> API for the application's persistence in the cloud.

          <h2>PlacedIt</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            PlacedIt is a IOS application to help the user keep track of where he/she placed his/her items. To use PlacedIt, the user simply selects an item and mark down the location of where they placed their item. The user also has the option to take a picture of the item(at its placed location) and write down notes about it. I built PlacedIt entirely from scratch. For development, I used Objectiive-C, Xcode, MapKit Framework, and Core Data for persistence. For design, I used Adobe Photoshop CC.

          <h2>Breakout</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Breakout was an assignment for a MOOC(Massive Open Online Course) that was provided by Stanford University. The game was originally created by Steve Wozniak before he started Apple with Steve Jobs. The goal of the game is to break through all of the bricks before you lose all of your lives. A life is lost each time the ball falls off the bottom of the screen(missing the ball with the paddle). The game was written in Java in Eclipse with an imported library provided by Stanford University. Breakout was the first project that I have ever built, so it was also the project that got me started into programming.
