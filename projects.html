            Have you ever tried making plans with a friends or family member just to find out that they already have plans? Who's Free is an IOS application that helps you know who is free when you are trying to make plans. To use Who's Free, a user simply sets their status as free or busy, then when there friends or family tries to message them or call the in the application, an alert view will show and the application will restrict them from calling or messaging the user. The pupose of this application is to allow the user to save time while trying to make plans or contact someone. It also allows one to know which one of their friends are busy. I built the whole application from start to finish using Objective-C and Xcode for the development. I also used <a href="https://www.parse.com/">Parse's</a> platform for the application's persistence in the cloud.

            PlacedIt is a IOS application to help the user keep track of where he/she placed his/her items. To use PlacedIt, the user simply selects an item and mark down the location of where they placed their item. The user also has the option to take a picture of the item(at its placed location) and write down notes about it. The app was influenced by a friends constant inability to find his keys. I built PlacedIt from scratch through both the development and design phases. For development, I used Objectiive-C, Xcode, MapKit Framework, and Core Data for persistence. For design, I used Adobe Photoshop CC.

          <h2>Breakout</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Breakout was an assignment for a MOOC(Massive Open Online Course) that was provided by Stanford University. The game was originally created by Steve Wozniak before he started Apple with Steve Jobs. The goal of the game is to break through all of the bricks before you lose all of your lives. A life is lost each time the ball falls off the bottom of the screen(missing the ball with the paddle). The game was created in Java with Eclipse and an imported library provided by Stanford University. Breakout was the first project that I have ever built, so it was also the project that got me started into programming.
