      <h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>
        Growing up, I have always had a passion for math, science, and technology. My interests was always drawn to math and science in school because of the problem solving involved in these subjects. When given a difficult problem, I always tackle the problem by breaking the problem down into smaller problems and worked my way through them. Problem solving became second nature to me because of the tremendous amount of satisfication provided to me once the probem is solved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from academics, sports are my largest area of interest. I enjoy play sports, because I get to be around people and socialize with them. Working together with a team that has the same goals as me is what made sports fascinating to me. But, when I'm not playing sports, I usually go to movies or out to eat with friends or family. A drive for teamwork and socialization are the characteristics that have drawn me to these activities.
      </p>

        Throughout many years of my life, I knew I wanted to become an engineer, because the engineering way of thinking came naturally to me. The problem was that I was skeptical about which field of engineering I should embrace. It wasn't until my junior year of high school that I discovered the field of Computer Science and gave it a try. In the beginning, my constant failure to get my compiler running made me doubtful about pursuing the field. But, when I finally got it running and educated myself with some basics of programming, I knew this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Since then, I have been developing my skills more and more each day until this day by devoting a couple hours a day to programming. I recently established an interest in mobile development, but I am also open to try many other fields in Computer Science or Software Engineering.
